# 42_Cube3d
## Description:

This repository contains an implementation of a basic 3D game engine created from scratch in C, inspired by the raycasting technique used in "Wolfenstein 3D". The Cub3D project focuses on rendering a first-person perspective view of a 3D maze or environment while providing interactive controls and simple graphics.

## Key Features:

Implementation of a raycasting-based 3D game engine using the C programming language.
Rendering of a first-person perspective view within a maze or map environment.
Graphics rendering functionalities to display walls, textures, sprites, and colors.
User interaction handling for movement controls (e.g., walking, turning) within the 3D environment.
Map parsing and interpretation for loading and rendering game levels from configuration files.
Optimization techniques for efficient rendering and performance improvements.
Optional additional features such as minimap display, sprite rendering, or extended textures.
## Purpose:

Developed as a learning project to explore computer graphics, raycasting, and game engine development concepts.
Offers practical experience in graphics programming, 3D rendering, and optimization techniques.
Encourages independent learning, problem-solving, and implementation of algorithms learned during the course.
## Usage:

Clone the repository and compile/run the provided C source code using a compatible C compiler.
Experiment with the provided functionalities, user controls, and map configurations.
Observe the rendered 3D environment and interact with the game level.
## Note:

This repository contains a basic implementation of a raycasting-based 3D game engine and may be part of an educational course or programming project.
Contributions, optimizations, or additional features to enhance the 3D engine are welcomed for further exploration and improvement
